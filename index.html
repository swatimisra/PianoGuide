        <h2>Step 1: Get familiar with the key names</h2>
        <img

        <p>
            As you can see, the notes of the piano are labeled alphabetically, starting at A and going to G. 
            All white keys progress in succession, while black keys are labeled with a "#". These are called the 
            "sharp" keys. It is important to know these keys when reading sheet music so you know where to put your fingers.

            <strong>Important Note:</strong> When moving left to right on the piano, black keys are "sharp keys". When moving right to left,
            these keys are "flat" keys and are denoted with the symbol seen in the image above. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Get familiar with the note names (in sheet music)</h2>
        <img
        src= "https://musictheoryexamreview.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/3/6/51368825/833952994.gif"

        >
        <p>
            In the image above, you can see that there are two rows of bars, these are called "staffs". The one on top is the 
            treble staff (denoted with a treble clef) and the one below is the bass staff (denoted with a bass clef).
            These notes are also in alphabetical succession with the treble clef starting at C and the bass clef starting at E. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Many people use mnemonic devices to remember these note names. A common device for the treble clef is "Every Good Boy Does Fine" 
            for the notes on the lines and "FACE" for the spaces. One for the bass clef is "Goofy Bounces Down Fifth Avenue" for the lines and
            "All Cows Eat Grass" for the spaces. These may be useful for you to remember!
        </p>
